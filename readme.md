## What is...and Whats is not

[elFinder](http://elfinder.org/) is an open-source file manager for web, written in JavaScript using jQuery UI. Creation is inspired by simplicity and convenience of Finder program used in Mac OS X operating system.

This module integrate elFinder in an ImpressCMS site as a module and in tinyMCE editor. Creating or editing a page using that Editor you can upload files and insert download links in it. It was done using the Blank module by Madfish as base.

ImpressCMS has a great Imagemanager, but just now not a File or Media Manager and only article module by qm-b has upload files feature. Using this module you solve the problem, but really it is not a File Manager as Imagemanager core feature; only an external aplication integration as module.

This module uses User Groups Permissions feature; but further tests and research about security are neccesaries.

## Extras

### Compres-Uncompress files

Imagine: your fist root is `/uploads` folder, the second `/modules`...you could upload a zip module file, uncompress it and go to Control Panel for installation within ImpressCMS. However note that feature is not PHP related. elFinder does not support PHP zip/zlib modules, it work's only with UNIX command-line utilities. There are autodetect feature; if you have problems, contact with your host provider.
